# Release Notes - v3.1.0

Welcome to version 3.1.0 of the adapter toolkit for App Store Connect!


# Changes

This release includes the following changes and features:


## New package for hosting adapter HTTP APIs as Minimal API routes

A [new package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/IntelligentPlant.AppStoreConnect.Adapter.AspNetCore.MinimalApi) has been introduced for hosting the adapter HTTP APIs using ASP.NET Core's Minimal APIs functionality instead of MVC controllers.

Please note that Minimal API support requires ASP.NET Core 7.0 or higher. If you create an adapter host project from the Visual Studio/`dotnet new` template that targets .NET 7.0 or higher, the project will automatically use the Minimal APIs package instead of the MVC package.

Instructions for updating an existing adapter host project to use Minimal APIs can be found [here](../../src/DataCore.Adapter.AspNetCore.MinimalApi/README.md).


## ASP.NET Core adapter template uses Bootstrap 5.3

The ASP.NET Core adapter host template now uses Bootstrap 5.3 and includes built-in support for light and dark display modes.


## New `IAdapterCallContext<T>` interface

[IAdapterCallContext&lt;T&gt;](../../src/DataCore.Adapter.Abstractions/IAdapterCallContextT.cs) is a new interface that extends `IAdapterCallContext` to expose a `Provider` property of type `T`. 

The [HttpAdapterCallContext](../../src/DataCore.Adapter.AspNetCore.Common/HttpAdapterCallContext.cs) class passed by ASP.NET Core host applications to adapter method invocations has been modified to implement `IAdapterCallContext<HttpContext>`, meaning that hosted adapters are now able to use the `HttpContext` for a caller inside the adapter (for example, in order to pass through authentication details such as a bearer token or X.509 client certificate for the caller to a downstream service used by the adapter).


## Configurable adapter host instance IDs and fixed adapter IDs

The adapter host template project now sets the ID of the hosted adapter to `$default` instead of a GUID generated at project creation time. This allows for easier configuration of the App Store Connect to adapter connection. The adapter ID can still be modified in the same way as before by editing the `Constants.cs` file in projects created using the Visual Studio/`dotnet new` template. 

Additionally, the identifier that the adapter host uses in its OpenTelemetry traces is now set via the project's `appsettings.json` file (or any other configuration source that the project uses). This allows for tracing systems such as Jaeger to distinguish between multiple instances of an adapter host.


# Upgrading from v3.0.0 to 3.1.0

To upgrade from v3.0.0 to v3.1.0, you just need to update your adapter toolkit package references to version 3.1.0.

If you have installed the adapter host project template for Visual Studio and `dotnet new`, you can upgrade the template to the latest version by running `dotnet new update` from the command line.
