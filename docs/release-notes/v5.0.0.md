# Release Notes - v5.0.0

Welcome to version 5.0.0 of the adapter toolkit for App Store Connect!


# Breaking Changes

This release contains the following breaking changes:


## Changes to Entity Builder Types

Types such as `TagValueBuilder` that are used to construct adapter entities using a fluent interface have been refactored to derive from a common base type, `AdapterEntityBuilder<T>`. The base type defines some common behaviour such as management of custom `AdapterProperty` properties added to the builder.

Duplicate properties can no longer be defined on any builder derived from `AdapterEntityBuilder<T>`. Instead, callers can choose whether existing properties with the same name should be retained or dropped when adding properties to the builder.

Note that `AdapterEntityBuilder<T>` does not define any public methods for adding properties to the builder; these are instead provided by extension methods defined on the `AdapterEntityBuilderExtensions` class.


## Hash Code Computation in `TagIdentifierComparer`

The hash code computation in `TagIdentifierComparer` has been modified to remove unnecessary allocations. A side effect of this change is that the hash code computed for a given `TagIdentifier` is now different.
