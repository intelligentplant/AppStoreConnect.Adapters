# DataCore.Adapter.Abstractions

This project contains core types and abstractions for implementing an App Store Connect Adapter. An adapter is a component that exposes real-time process data and/or alarm & event data to App Store Connect. This data can then be used by apps on the [Industrial App Store](https://appstore.intelligentplant.com) such as [Gestalt Trend](https://appstore.intelligentplant.com/Home/AppProfile?appId=3fbd54df59964243aa9cf4b3f04823f6) and [Alarm Analysis](https://appstore.intelligentplant.com/Home/AppProfile?appId=d2322b59ff334c97b49760e40000d28e).
