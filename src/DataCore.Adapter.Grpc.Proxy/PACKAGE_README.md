# About

IntelligentPlant.AppStoreConnect.Adapter.Grpc.Proxy contains a proxy for querying a hosted App Store Connect adapter using gRPC. Note that .NET Framework compatibility is subject to Microsoft's constraints as described [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/grpc/netstandard#net-framework).

App Store Connect adapters allow you to easily connect your own custom data sources to the Intelligent Plant [Industrial App Store](https://appstore.intelligentplant.com/) platform.

For more information about writing custom adapters, [visit the GitHub repository](https://github.com/intelligentplant/AppStoreConnect.Adapters/).
